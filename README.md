# The Meta-Memory in Alzheimer's Disease (MMAD) Package

The `mmad` package is designed to be used in preclinical AD cohorts. It allows to compute three different measure of awareness: the *Meta-Memory Ratio* (MMR), the *Awareness of Cognitive Decline Categorization* (ACDC) and the *Awareness for Cognitive Decline Index* (ACDI).

The MMR and the ACDC are based on the Participant-Performance Discrepancy, i.e. the difference between a participant's subjective appraisal of her/his cognition, and her/his objective performance.

The MMR is numeric continuous measure, centered around 0 which corresponds to a good match between subjective and objective performance. A positive score indicates a SCD, and a negative stands for a lack of awareness.

The ACDC, based on the same inputs, categorized the participant as:

  * *Normal*: Good objective and subjective performances.
  * *Amnestic*: Low objective and subjective performances.
  * *SCD*: Low subjective but normal objective performance.
  * *LowAwareness*: normal subjective but low subjective performance.
  
The ACDI is based on the Participant-Informant Discrepancy. As for the MMR, it's a numeric continuous measure, centered around 0 which corresponds to a good match between subjective and objective performance. A positive score indicates a SCD, and a negative stands for a lack of awareness.

All of the measures are designed to be used in multiple preclincal AD samples, either for one or multiples visits.
