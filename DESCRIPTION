Description: The mmad package is designed to be used in preclinical AD cohorts.
    It allows to compute three different measure of awareness: the Meta-
    Memory Ratio (MMR), the Awareness of Cognitive Decline Categorization
    (ACDC), and the Awareness for Cognitive Decline Index (ACDI).
    The MMR and ACDC are both based on the Participant-Performance
    Discrepancy, i.e. the difference between a participant's subjective
    appraisal of her/his cognition, and her/his objective performance. The MMR
    is numeric continuous measure, centered around 0 which corresponds to 
    a good match between subjective and objective performance. A positive score 
    indicates a SCD, and a negative stands for a lack of awareness. The ACDC,
    based on the same inputs, categorized the participant as: Normal, 
    SCD, LowAwareness or Amnestic.
    The ACDI is based on the Participant-Informant Discrepancy. 
    All of the measures are designed to be used in multiple preclincal AD
    samples, either for one or multiples visits.
